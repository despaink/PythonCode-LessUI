# Flutter-LessUI
Using a Raspberrypi attached to a Local Area Network, listening for DHCP packets, notifications are
pushed to devices on the network when a device connects to the network. Users can choose to ignore
that device in the future or opt in to be notified when that device connects. This repo contains the
Raspberrypi code. For the mobile app code, see: https://github.com/despaink/Flutter-LessUI


# Why
This is a school project that I built as part of a UX class. Its not a polished or finished product,
but the general functionality I was shooting for is there.
